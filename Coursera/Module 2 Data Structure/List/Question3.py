#8.5 Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
#From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
#You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message). 
#Then print out a count at the end.
#Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'. Also look at the last line of the sample output to see how to print the count.

a = open(r"D:\python\Coursera\Module 2 Data Structure\List\email.txt")

count = 0

for line in a:
    if line.startswith("From "):
        words = line.split()
        print(words[1])
        count += 1

print("There were", count, "lines in the file with From as the first word")
