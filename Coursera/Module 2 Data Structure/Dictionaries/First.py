# Dictionary example
cabinet = dict()

cabinet['summer'] = 12
cabinet['fall'] = 3
cabinet['spring'] = 75

print(cabinet)

# List example
minister = list()

minister.append("Summer")

print(minister)


# Now the basic difference is dictionary store "Key" as well as "Value" whereas list store "Value" only

print(cabinet['summer'])
